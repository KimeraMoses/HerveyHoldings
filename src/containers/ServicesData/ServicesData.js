      "We see hoardings every single day. They fade into the background on our morning commute. They serve as the backdrop to our lunch time walks. Steel hoarding panels mask unsightly building works and keep us safe from the construction works going on behind their panels. Consequently, whether made from painted wooden boards or high-quality printed free standing panels, they are an essential part of construction works. In addition, marketers are starting to see the huge advertising potential of these wide-format printed panels. Hoardings have the power to position products infront of viewers in a non-intrusive manner.",
