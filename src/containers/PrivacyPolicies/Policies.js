            When you travel with us, we want you to have the experience you’ve
            been imagining. And, when you’re looking for inspiration and help on
            planning your next trip, we want to give you the ideas you’re
            looking for. To help us do this, we need to ask you for a little
            personal information. But, we know how important it is to keep your
            personal information safe, and we’ll always be open with you about
            how we collect and keep it.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll ask you for information such as your name and contact
          information, your email address, and, if you travel with us, your
          passport details. We collect your personal data for three main
          reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you visit our website or use our mobile and/or tablet apps, to
            give you the best possible experience, based on what you want to
            find out and which device you’re using.
          </li>
          <li>
            So we can contact you successfully, if you get in touch or ask us
            for information.
          </li>
          <li>
            And, when we’re planning your trip, to ensure that we make the right
            arrangements for you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re travelling with us, we’ll ask you to tell us a little more
          about yourself, such as any health conditions. We only do this so we
          can plan your trip around any special requirements you might have.
        </p>
        <h4>How we share your personal information</h4>
        <p>
          We’ll only either ask you for personal information directly or, with
          your permission, gather it by tracking how you use our website or our
          mobile and/or tablet apps. We won’t share your personal information
          with third parties for any marketing activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we do share your personal information, it’s always so we can
          provide you with a better service when you’re travelling with us.
        </p>

        <h4>Safeguarding your personal information</h4>
        <p>
          We keep your personal information securely, and we only keep it for
          limited and appropriate amounts of time. If you’d like to stop
          receiving our email marketing, you can click ‘unsubscribe’ at any
          time.
        </p>
        <h4>Your rights to your personal information</h4>
        <p>
          You can contact us at any time if you have questions, concerns,
          comments, requests or complaints regarding our privacy policy or your
          personal information. Please email us at{" "}
          <a href="mailto:info@davsafaris.com">info@davsafaris.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any comments regarding this privacy policy or the way we
          handle your personal information, you can also contact us.
        </p>

        <h4>Changes to our privacy policy</h4>
        <p>
          From time to time, we might review our privacy policy and make changes
          to it. If we do this, we’ll always highlight it on our website and,
          where appropriate, let you know by email.
